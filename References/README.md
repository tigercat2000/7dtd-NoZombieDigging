To build this mod, it needs references to the following dll files in `7 Days To Die/7DaysToDie_Data/Managed`:

- `0Harmony`
- `Assembly-CSharp`
- `LogLibrary`
- `mscorlib`
- `System`
- `System.Core`
- `System.Data`
- `System.Xml`
- `UnityEngine`
- `UnityEngine.CoreModule`

Stubs are provided using [BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer)

For actual development, you'll probably want to replace these stubs with real dlls from 7DTD.
